A simple and fun Python console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and the player has to guess it.
After each guess, the game gives hints — Too high or Too low — until the correct number is found.
A perfect beginner-friendly project to practice loops, condition checks, and user interaction in Python.
